    <h3>OOP's foundational concepts: encapsulation,inheritance, and polymorphism.</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>Encapsulation</summary>
        The practice of separating the user from the true inner workings of an application through well-known interfaces is
        known as encapsulation.
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Inheritance</summary>
        In OOP, inheritance is a programming procedure that allows you to reuse code by referencing the behaviors and data of an object. <br>
        This strategy promotes code reusability because it assumes that one will be able to use well-designed classes within numerous applications.
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Polymorphism</summary>
        Polymorphism describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface

<h3>Class</h3>
<p>A class is a template definition of the properties and methods in a particular kind of object. That means class has properties and methods from which object is created(instantiated)</p>
