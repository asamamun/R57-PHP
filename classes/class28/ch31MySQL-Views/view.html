    <h3>View</h3>
    <p> a view consists of a set of rows that is returned if a particular query is executed. A view isn't a copy of the data represented by the query, but rather it simplifies the way in which that data can be retrieved by making the query available via an alias.</p>
    <pre>
        create or replace view productlt100 as select * from products where price < 100;
    </pre>

    <pre>
        SELECT * FROM `products` WHERE price > (select avg(`price`) from products where 1) ORDER BY `price` DESC
